Every time I'm in town I have to come get my honey vanilla latte and bacon and egg bagel. I highly recommend stopping by if you are in town."</p>

We went in and ordered a falafel a chicken gyro based on the recommendation of the lady behind the counter.  She was extremely nice and helpful.  We asked if it would take a whole and she said no and she was right!  The food came out quick and was so fresh.  The gyro was amazing!  It was marinated so perfectly! Definitely visit if you're in the area!"</p>

                            <p>"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots. I've never had a problem getting a bar table and I've found the staff super friendly. I think their happy hour food deals are some of the best around. You can get pho for $8 and a number of other really great snacks for the same amount of less. One of my favorites is the tofu and cabbage salad, which doesn't sound exciting, but once you try the dressing and the crispy shallots on it, you will be hooked! I think their portions are pretty generous, too so two people can feel satisfied with only a few items."</p>

                            <p>"Love this spot, especially for those REALLY LATE night eats. Tons of vegetarian options and always great, fresh ingredients. Service is a bit spotty at times but worth it. They're almost always packed which is of course a good sign. Reasonably priced and I really enjoy the darker mellow ambiance. They can accommodate groups but it's nice to just go with one other person. Food comes out relatively quickly depending on how busy they are."</p>

Fresh and delicious food...we sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly.   Met some other patrons who seemed to be locals and they were friendly as well.

                                I highly recommend the Xiu Mai...they are fabulous meatballs in a sauce with bread and the pho ga is good too.
                                
                                We will be back soon."</p>
